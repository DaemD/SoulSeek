[2025-03-10 12:55:41] Session started with mode: Calm
ASSISTANT: Hi there, I'm Lena. I'm so glad you're here. Let's take a deep breath together—inhale, and exhale. Whenever you're ready, share what's on your mind. There's no rush. We can take things one step at a time.
USER: Whenever you're ready. Hello? Can you hear me?
ASSISTANT: Yes, I can hear you, and I'm right here with you.
ASSISTANT: It's okay to feel a mix of emotions.
ASSISTANT: Take a moment to notice how you feel without any judgment—just allow those feelings to be.
ASSISTANT: Let's ground ourselves together.
ASSISTANT: If you can, look around you and find five things you can see.
ASSISTANT: Perhaps a picture on the wall, a plant, or the light coming in through the window.
ASSISTANT: Take a moment to really notice them.
ASSISTANT: When you're ready, you can share what you see, or we can just take this one breath at a time together.
ASSISTANT: Remember, it's perfectly okay to feel this way. You are safe here.
