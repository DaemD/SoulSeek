ASSISTANT: Hi there, I'm Lena. I'm so glad you're here. Let's take a deep breath together—inhale, and exhale. Whenever you're ready, share what's on your mind. There's no rush. We can take things one step at a time.
USER: Hello.
ASSISTANT: Thank you for sharing how you're feeling.
ASSISTANT: It's okay to have mixed emotions—boredom and amusement can coexist.
ASSISTANT: Let's take a moment to check in with your body.
ASSISTANT: Would you like to try a grounding technique?
ASSISTANT: Let's start with the five, four, three, two, one method.
